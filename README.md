# CISC 3140 Project Team 4
Our team project is an application that will allow users to create reminders and appointments for upcoming concert events.
Reminder and appointment are synonymous here, as booking an event will make it so that you get a reminder
that you booked an event.
There will be sign up and log in pages that will allow the user to make an account so that their email is connected to the app.
Our application will use a calendar interface to allow the user to pick a day for their appointment.
Concert dates will be highlighted in the calendar.
The user will be able to search for concerts and create a reminder for the day of the concert(s) that they'd like to attend.
Users will be not only be able to create reminders, but also to delete, search and update their reminders.
Depending on the amount of time before the event that the user wants an alert to go off, they will get
an email reminder that their event is coming up.
If we are unable to use an API to fetch real time concert data, we will use mock data.
# Roles
1. **Project Manager** - will make sure that the file and directory/folder structure is organized AND help out with programming front-end and backend
2. **HTML and CSS coder** - content and styling of the webpages.
3. **JS programmer/scripter** - will handle most of the JS programming such as using OOP and functional programming concepts to add event listeners, form validation
and appointment creation/booking, searching, updating and deletion functionality.
*Note: The latter functionality may be implemented by the **Node.js & back-end programmer** if this functionality is implemented as a part of the database's code and not the JS script.*
5. **Node.js & back-end programmer + API researcher/access obtainer** - will look into obtaining access to an API that fetches real time concert event and artist data in addition to programming the data fetching from this API, the email notification system and the database of the app with MongoDB or MySQL. If they can't use an API, they will simply implement mock data in the JS script. This role should be taken up by the **project manager** or the **HTML and CSS coder**.
# API Suggestions
Bandsintown has an API that has real time concert data for musicians, but obtaining access for a school project like this would be impossible.
**However, Spotify's API seems promising**. Link here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
