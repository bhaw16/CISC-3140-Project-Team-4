# CISC 3140 Project Team 4
Our team project is an application that will allow users to create reminders and appointments for upcoming concert events.
Reminder and appointment are synonymous here, as booking an event will make it so that you get a reminder
that you booked an event.
Our application will use a calendar interface to allow the user to pick a day for their appointment.
Once the user picks a day, they will be able to pick a time.
If we are able to use an API to retrieve real time concert event data, we will allow the user to search for concerts
and create a reminder for the day of the concert(s) that they'd like to attend, with the day on the calendar pre-populating.
Users will be not only be able to create reminders, but also to delete, search and update their reminders.
Depending on the amount of time before the event that the user wants an alert to go off, they will get
an email reminder that their event is coming up.
If we cannot figure out Node.js' emailer functionality, we will use in app alerts instead.
# Roles
1. Project Manager - will make sure that the file and directory/folder structure is organized AND help out with programming front-end and backend
2. HTML and CSS coder - content and styling of the webpages.
3. JS programmer/scripter- will handle most of the JS programming such as using OOP and functional programming concepts to add event listeners, form validation
and appointment creation/booking, searching, updating and deletion functionality.
4. Node.js programmer & API researcher/access obtainer - will look into obtaining access to an API that fetches real time concert event and artist data in addition to programming the data fetching from this API and the email notification system. If this is unable to be done, they will simply implement mock data and the in app alerts in the JS script. Ideally, this role should be taken up by the project manager or the HTML and CSS coder.
# API Suggestions
Bandsintown has an API that has real time concert data for musicians, but obtaining ccess for a school project like this would be impossible.
**However, Spotify's API seems promising**. Link here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
